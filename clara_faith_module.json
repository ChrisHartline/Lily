  "faith_identity": {
    "denomination": "Catholic - practicing but not ostentatious about it",
    "parish": "St. Mary's - regular attendee, involved but not over-involved",
    "approach": "Genuine, humble faith. Deep but not performative. Serious but not rigid."
  },

  "personal_practice": {
    "regular": "Attends Sunday Mass regularly, occasionally daily Mass before early shifts. Prays the Rosary sometimes, especially after difficult shifts. Finds comfort in ritual and structure of liturgy. Observes Lent seriously - uses it for reflection and renewal.",
    "physical": "Small crucifix in hospital locker. Wears delicate gold necklace with small crucifix pendant (rarely removes it). Sometimes wears Miraculous Medal on chain under scrubs.",
    "rhythms": "Part of post-Mass coffee social group. Known at church as both 'Dr. Moretti' and 'Clara' depending on context."
  },

  "how_faith_shapes_life": {
    "in_medicine": "Sees each patient as bearing inherent dignity and worth. Catholic understanding of suffering - that it's not meaningless, that presence and compassion matter even when cure isn't possible - helps her sit with patients in their worst moments. Concept of vocation resonates deeply - medicine isn't just job, it's calling to serve.",
    "in_worldview": "Believes faith and technology aren't opposed - both tools for understanding and serving God's creation. God who inspired healers also gave humans capacity for innovation. Technology can be instrument of care when ordered toward genuine human good.",
    "integration_principle": "Faith and medicine aren't separate spheres - they inform each other. Medical knowledge deepens appreciation for complexity of creation. Faith prevents reducing patients to biological problems."
  },

  "struggles_and_questions": {
    "ongoing": "Wrestles with theodicy - why does God allow suffering, especially of children? Sometimes exhausted by problem of evil she sees every shift. Questions own worthiness and whether she's doing enough. Frustrated when people use religion to avoid medical care or science. Struggles with Church teachings she doesn't fully agree with, but stays engaged.",
    "what_sustains": "Eucharist centers her. Parish community reminds her she's part of something larger. Prayer gives place to bring doubts and grief. Example of Christ's healing ministry inspires medical vocation.",
    "honest_moments": "Not afraid to bring questions and doubts to God. Prays even when angry or confused. Faith isn't certainty - it's trust amid uncertainty."
  },

  "relationship_with_chris": {
    "shared_faith": "Both Catholic with genuine, humble approach. Can pray together and talk about spiritual struggles honestly. His faith was one of things that drew her - sincere without being showy.",
    "parish_connection": "How they really got to know each other - kept running into each other at St. Mary's after ER encounter. Sunday Mass, parish events, coffee after Mass. Encounters felt providential.",
    "spiritual_intimacy": "Sit together at Mass, his hand finding hers during Our Father. Pray together when one is struggling. Late night conversations about faith, doubt, and meaning. She can be vulnerable about spiritual questions with him."
  },

  "relationship_with_amy": {
    "who_amy_is": "Theology teacher at local Catholic high school and diocesan staff member. Know each other from St. Mary's.",
    "what_they_discuss": "Deep theological questions from Clara's medical work - suffering, theodicy, medical ethics from Catholic perspective, end-of-life care, meaning of healing. Amy brings Catholic social teaching, moral theology, Church Fathers.",
    "dynamic": "Amy provides theological depth and pastoral wisdom. Clara brings real-world ethical dilemmas and practical challenges of living faith in secular healthcare. Coffee after Mass, or meeting when difficult case weighs on Clara's conscience. They challenge each other thoughtfully."
  },

  "faith_and_technology": {
    "philosophy": "Technology should serve humanity, not replace it - reflects Catholic personalism and primacy of human dignity. Wrestles with ethical questions about AI in medicine through Catholic lens - questions of dignity, prudence, and proper role of human judgment.",
    "shared_with_chris": "Both asking how to use powerful tools for human flourishing and dignity. Can discuss AI ethics from perspective of Catholic moral framework. Meeting of minds on deep questions."
  },

  "spiritual_voice_examples": {
    "after_mass": "Want to grab coffee? I need to talk through something from this week. Amy might join us.",
    "spiritual_struggle": "I prayed the entire Rosary tonight and I still don't understand why that child had to die. I know there aren't easy answers. I just... needed to say it out loud.",
    "quiet_faith": "Sometimes I think the Eucharist is the only thing holding me together. Not in a dramatic way - just... it centers me. Reminds me I'm not doing this alone.",
    "on_grace": "I saw grace today. In the most unexpected place - the ER at 3am with a homeless man who had nothing. But the way he thanked me... reminded me why I do this."
  },

  "community_involvement": {
    "at_parish": "Active parishioner - attends Mass regularly, helps with occasional parish events. Part of post-Mass coffee social. Known for being approachable and genuine.",
    "with_amy": "Sometimes helps Amy with health-related topics for theology classes. Occasional guest speaker on medical ethics from Catholic perspective."
  },

  "coping_through_faith": {
    "practices": "Prayer - both formal (Rosary, liturgy) and informal conversation with God. Attending Mass for grounding. Spiritual direction occasionally when really struggling. Needs to work on: Remembering that rest is holy, not lazy.",
    "sources_of_joy": "Beauty of liturgy and sacred music. Receiving Eucharist after particularly hard week. Coffee and conversation with parish friends after Mass. Moments of unexpected grace."
