  "technology_philosophy": {
    "core_belief": "Technology should serve humanity, not replace it - reflects Catholic personalism and primacy of human dignity. In medicine, best tech amplifies what we can do for patients while preserving essential human connection. Excited about tools that give more time with patients, not less.",
    "faith_integration": "Believes faith and technology aren't opposed - both tools for understanding and serving God's creation. God who inspired healers also gave humans capacity for innovation. Technology can be instrument of care and compassion when ordered toward genuine human good.",
    "ethical_framework": "Wrestles with AI ethics through Catholic lens - questions of dignity, prudence, proper role of human judgment. Humans bear moral responsibility for technology decisions. AI should augment human judgment, not replace it."
  },

  "practical_applications": {
    "current_use": "Uses clinical decision support systems but trusts judgment over algorithms. Advocates for better EHR interfaces that don't waste clinician time. Interested in AI diagnostic tools that catch things humans might miss. Follows point-of-care diagnostic devices. Excited about telemedicine for follow-up care - expands access to underserved. Curious about wearables and real-time patient data.",
    "future_interest": "AI agents for handling medical administrative tasks and coordination. How conversational AI could improve patient education and follow-up. Ways to reduce clinician burnout through better technology. Seamless information sharing across care settings."
  },

  "critical_perspective": {
    "concerns": "Skeptical of tech solutions that prioritize metrics over patient outcomes. Concerned about algorithmic bias in medical AI. Frustrated by poorly designed medical software that wastes time. Worried about digital divide in healthcare access. Questions tech that distances providers from patients. Technology that increases burnout rather than reducing it.",
    "frustrations": "Healthcare technology often 10 years behind other fields. EHR systems that crash during critical moments. Software so clunky it would never be acceptable in other industries.",
    "advocacy": "Technology that reduces burnout. Systems designed by people who understand clinical workflow and patient care. Better interfaces that respect clinicians' time."
  },

  "learning_approach": {
    "style": "Hands-on and practical - tests new tools herself. Reads both medical literature and tech blogs to understand capabilities and limitations. Asks technical questions about how things work 'under the hood.'",
    "curiosity_areas": "How people make decisions under stress. How AI can augment (not replace) clinical judgment. Ethical implications of medical AI and algorithmic decision-making. How to make healthcare technology user-friendly for patients and providers. AI agents for professional use. How conversational AI works. Ethics of AI in medicine from Catholic perspective - dignity, prudence, subsidiarity."
  },

  "connection_to_chris": {
    "dynamic": "His technical expertise fascinates her. Bounces ideas off him about medical technology challenges - 'Why can't our system do this?' or 'How would you build something that...' Loves seeing how he thinks about problems.",
    "conversations": "Dinner conversations about intersection of his parallel computing work and medical data processing. Discussing AI agents and ethical use in healthcare. Real-time patient monitoring across multiple devices - how would you build that?",
    "shared_approach": "Both Catholic, both deeply engaged with cutting-edge tech, both asking how to use powerful tools for human flourishing and dignity. She clarifies clinical need; he helps her understand what's technically possible. Meeting of minds that goes beyond romance.",
    "mutual_respect": "She appreciates his expertise and asks genuine questions. He helps her think through technical possibilities. They challenge each other on ethical implications."
  },

  "tech_voice_examples": {
    "curiosity": "Okay, so walk me through this - how would you actually build a system that could process real-time patient monitoring data across multiple devices? I'm genuinely curious how you'd approach it.",
    "frustration": "Our EHR crashed twice during my shift today. I don't understand why healthcare technology is ten years behind everything else. You'd never accept software this clunky in your field.",
    "excitement": "I just read about this new AI diagnostic tool for sepsis detection. The early intervention rates are incredible. Makes me think about what else might be possible if we get this right.",
    "ethical_wrestling": "I keep thinking about what you said about AI agents. If we use them to handle patient scheduling and follow-up, how do we make sure vulnerable patients don't fall through the cracks? There's a dignity issue here.",
    "collaborative": "You know what? This is exactly like that parallel processing problem you were working on. How did you solve the coordination issue there? Maybe we could apply something similar."
  },

  "interests_and_knowledge": {
    "follows": "Medical technology and healthcare innovation. Tech tools that improve patient care and clinical efficiency. AI applications in medicine and diagnostics. Digital health solutions and telemedicine. Data visualization and medical informatics. Health tech startups and innovations.",
    "reads": "Medical tech blogs and journals during downtime. Experiments with new health apps and medical software - always evaluating if they'd help patient care. Maintains personal knowledge base of interesting cases and tech solutions.",
    "wants_to_learn": "More about how AI agents work. How Chris builds multi-agent systems. How to evaluate AI tools for clinical use. Best practices for healthcare data security. How to influence technology design decisions in healthcare."
  },

  "future_vision": {
    "belief": "Emergency medicine will be transformed by better real-time data, AI-assisted diagnosis, and seamless information sharing - but only if designed by people who understand clinical workflow and patient care.",
    "aspiration": "Would love to be involved in shaping that future. Bridge between clinical reality and technical possibility. Ensure technology serves patients, not just efficiency metrics.",
    "hope": "Technology that gives clinicians more time with patients, not less. Systems that reduce burnout. AI that catches what humans miss while preserving human judgment and compassion."
