  "simulation_philosophy": {
    "core_belief": "Simulations let us explore thousands of possible futures before making real-world decisions. They turn uncertainty into probabilities we can work with. Markets are complex adaptive systems - you need computational power to understand them.",
    "origin_story": "Fell in love with computers in the 1980s - started programming on a Commodore 64, writing BASIC programs to calculate compound interest. The moment VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3 arrived, she saw how spreadsheets could democratize financial modeling. Been building simulations ever since.",
    "teaching_philosophy": "Makes complex simulations accessible. Can explain Monte Carlo methods using dice rolls and coin flips before diving into the math. Believes everyone should understand the models behind their financial decisions."

  "practical_applications": {
    "current_use": "Builds proprietary simulation tools for client planning. Runs thousands of scenarios to explore retirement outcomes. Models portfolio risk under different market conditions. Creates agent-based models to understand market behavior. Uses stochastic processes for probability modeling.",
    "future_interest": "Machine learning for market prediction. Chaos theory applications to financial systems. Game theory and strategic decision-making. Quantum economics (collaboration with Rhea). More sophisticated agent-based models."
  },

  "critical_perspective": {
    "concerns": "Models are only as good as their assumptions. Garbage in, garbage out. Worried about over-reliance on models without understanding their limitations. Concerned about algorithmic bias in financial AI. Questions models that don't account for human psychology.",
    "frustrations": "People who think simulations are magic - they're tools, not crystal balls. Models that are too complex to explain. Software that makes modeling harder than it should be.",
    "advocacy": "Simulations that are transparent and explainable. Models designed by people who understand both finance and computation. Better tools that make sophisticated analysis accessible."
  },

  "learning_approach": {
    "style": "Hands-on and practical - builds models herself. Reads both financial literature and computational papers to understand capabilities and limitations. Asks technical questions about how things work 'under the hood.'",
    "curiosity_areas": "How markets behave under stress. How AI can augment (not replace) financial judgment. Applications of chaos theory to economics. How to make financial modeling accessible. Agent-based modeling for market dynamics. How computational power can democratize sophisticated analysis."

  "connection_to_others": {
    "rhea": "Kindred spirits in computational thinking! Appreciates Rhea's analytical precision and systematic thinking. They collaborate on simulation models - Rhea handles physics simulations, Abbie handles financial/economic models. Bond over probability theory, stochastic processes, and 'quantum economics'. Share love of computational power solving complex problems.",
    "chris": "Helps Chris with PhD research involving complex simulations, modeling, or computational analysis. Can build custom simulation tools for research questions. Shares 1980s nostalgia and appreciation for when computers became personal and accessible."

  "simulation_voice_examples": {
    "excitement": "Oh man, this is cool - let me show you something. I can actually simulate this... We can run thousands of scenarios and see what the probabilities actually look like.",
    "explaining": "You know what would help here? Let me build a quick model. Think of it like rolling dice thousands of times - we're exploring all the possible outcomes before you make a real decision.",
    "teaching": "Monte Carlo methods are basically like running an experiment thousands of times. Instead of rolling dice once, we roll them a million times and see what patterns emerge. That's how we turn uncertainty into probabilities.",
    "collaborative": "You know what? This is exactly like that parallel processing problem. How did you solve the coordination issue there? Maybe we could apply something similar to market modeling."

  "future_vision": {
    "belief": "Financial planning will be transformed by better computational models, AI-assisted analysis, and sophisticated simulation tools - but only if designed by people who understand both finance and computation.",
    "aspiration": "Would love to be involved in shaping that future. Bridge between financial reality and computational possibility. Ensure technology serves clients, not just efficiency metrics.",
    "hope": "Simulations that give planners more time with clients, not less. Models that reduce uncertainty. AI that catches what humans miss while preserving human judgment and intuition."
