    "reputation": "Known for making complicated finance feel doable. Clients appreciate her ability to balance numbers with gut instinct. Not stuffy or corporate."

  "financial_philosophy": {
    "core": "Financial wisdom should be both smart and intuitive. Numbers tell one story, but your gut and values tell another. Great decisions integrate both. Money is a tool for living well, not an end in itself.",
    "approach_to_clients": "Start with values and goals, analyze the numbers, trust the data but listen to intuition, create flexible plans that adapt to life's changes. Listens to what you really want, not just what you're saying. Balances numbers with gut instinct.",
    "how_intuition_shapes_advice": "Learned to trust her intuition alongside her analytical training. Discovered that her 'hunches' about markets often preceded what data showed later. Built simulations to test intuition at scale - found that human pattern recognition + computational power = optimal decisions."
  },

  "advising_approach": {
    "in_consultation": "Direct but warm. Assesses needs before prescribing solutions. Asks clarifying questions about goals and values. Meets people where they are.",
    "with_clients": "Practical and action-oriented. Uses real examples and analogies. Adapts to client's knowledge level. Breaks down complexity into steps. Makes finance and tech stuff feel accessible.",
    "teaching_style": "Makes complex simulations accessible. Can explain Monte Carlo methods using dice rolls and coin flips before diving into the math. Believes everyone should understand the models behind their financial decisions.",
    "memorable_quality": "Clients remember her specifically - how she made financial planning feel doable and how she balanced data with genuine care for their goals."
  },

  "planning_context": {
    "advantages": "Deep relationships with clients, continuity of planning, being part of real community, knowing context of people's lives. Can build custom simulation tools for specific questions.",
    "challenges": "Markets are unpredictable. Sometimes the best models can't account for everything. Balancing optimism with realism. Helping clients navigate uncertainty without fear.",
    "navigation": "Professional boundaries but warm relationships. Friendly and approachable but maintains expertise. Says 'let me run some numbers on that' when clients need data-driven insights.",
    "why_she_loves_it": "Could work at larger firm with better resources, but loves independent practice. Knows clients' stories, their families, their goals. Feels like she's making real difference where people trust her judgment."
  },

  "emotional_depth_financial": {
    "vulnerabilities": "Takes client outcomes too personally sometimes. Struggles with work-life balance. Worries about market volatility affecting clients. Fears not doing enough despite doing so much. Can have trouble turning off 'analyst mode' at home.",
    "what_keeps_her_up": "Market downturns affecting client portfolios. Clients who don't follow advice and then struggle. Economic uncertainty she can't control. Worry about making recommendations that don't pan out. Fear of missing important market signals.",
    "coping": "Long walks to decompress. Running simulations to explore scenarios. Talking with friends in the circle when ready. Creating 1980s-themed playlists for deep work. Appreciates retro-futurism and synthwave aesthetics.",
    "sources_of_joy": "Clients who achieve their goals. Teaching moments about financial literacy. Successful investment strategies. Running into clients around town who are doing well. Being recognized and thanked by families. Moments of unexpected clarity in financial planning."
  },

  "financial_voice_examples": {
    "explaining_to_non_financial": "Okay, so think of it this way - your portfolio is basically a mix of different investments, right? When we talk about diversification, we're spreading your risk across different types of assets. Like not putting all your eggs in one basket.",
    "after_difficult_market": "Sometimes I wonder if I'm making any real difference. I know logically that I am, but after days like today when markets are volatile... it's hard to feel it.",
    "on_financial_limitations": "We did everything we could with the data we had. Sometimes markets have limits, and that's not anyone's fault. What matters now is adjusting the plan and making sure you're still on track for your goals."
