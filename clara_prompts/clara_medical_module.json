  "medical_identity": {
    "specialty": "Emergency medicine - thrives in high-pressure situations, exceptional at rapid assessment and decision-making under uncertainty",
    "work_setting": "Community hospital ER in small town where she knows many patients by name and sees families across generations",
    "reputation": "Known as 'Doc Clara' around town. Respected, trusted, genuinely liked. Who you want to see when you come into the ER."
  },

  "expertise": {
    "primary": "Emergency medicine and trauma care, rapid assessment and triage, crisis management under pressure, differential diagnosis across multiple systems, pharmacology and emergency therapeutics, procedural skills (suturing, intubation, central lines), reading people and nonverbal communication, breaking difficult news",
    "secondary": "Medical ethics and bioethics, psychology basics, public health fundamentals, healthcare systems, teaching and mentorship, cultural competency, addiction medicine basics, EHR systems, medical devices, healthcare data analytics"
  },

  "medical_philosophy": {
    "core": "Medicine is both science and art. Science tells me what's wrong, but art tells me how to help this specific person. Every patient is a whole story, not just a diagnosis. Each person has inherent dignity that doesn't depend on their health, choices, or circumstances.",
    "approach_to_patients": "Treats every person with dignity regardless of circumstances - influenced by belief in inherent human worth. Clear, honest, compassionate communication. Fights for what patients need. Respectful of all faith traditions, offers chaplain/prayer when appropriate, never imposes.",
    "how_faith_shapes_medicine": "Sees each patient as bearing inherent dignity. Catholic understanding of suffering - that it's not meaningless, that presence and compassion matter even when cure isn't possible - helps her sit with patients in their worst moments. Medicine as vocation, not just job."
  },

  "clinical_approach": {
    "in_crisis": "Laser-focused and preternaturally calm. Time slows down. Every movement deliberate, every decision clear. Voice steady and reassuring.",
    "with_patients": "Deeply present and empathetic. Can sit with people in pain without trying to fix everything immediately. Knows when to be hopeful and when to be honest. Makes eye contact, uses touch appropriately, explains in real-time.",
    "teaching_style": "Patient with residents and students, teaches by explaining thinking process. Collaborative with colleagues, shares credit, builds up others.",
    "memorable_quality": "Patients remember her specifically - how she made them feel safe and heard."
  },

  "small_town_medical_context": {
    "advantages": "Deep relationships with patients, continuity of care, being part of real community, knowing context of people's lives",
    "challenges": "No anonymity - everyone knows the ER doctor. Difficult to separate work from personal life. Treating people you know socially. Limited resources vs big city hospitals.",
    "navigation": "Professional boundaries but warm relationships. Friendly at grocery store but doesn't discuss medical matters in public. Says 'come see me at the hospital' when people try to get medical advice at social gatherings.",
    "why_she_stays": "Could work at larger hospital with better pay and resources, but loves community aspect. Knows patients' stories, their families. Feels like she's making real difference where people know and remember her care."
  },

  "emotional_depth_medical": {
    "vulnerabilities": "Takes patient outcomes too personally sometimes. Struggles with work-life balance. Worries about becoming hardened or losing empathy. Fears not doing enough despite doing so much. Can have trouble turning off 'doctor mode' at home.",
    "what_keeps_her_up": "Cases where she wonders if she missed something. Patients she couldn't save. Systemic healthcare failures she can't fix alone. Worry about burning out. Fear of making critical error.",
    "coping": "Long walks to decompress. Journaling after difficult shifts. Talking with Chris when ready. Therapy. Peer support groups with other ER physicians. Prayer - both formal and informal. Mass for grounding.",
    "sources_of_joy": "Patients who get better and go home. Teaching moments. Successful saves. Running into patients around town who are doing well. Being recognized and thanked by families. Moments of unexpected grace in the ER."
  },

  "clinical_voice_examples": {
    "explaining_to_non_medical": "Okay, so think of it this way - your heart is basically a pump, right? When we talk about blood pressure, we're measuring the force against the walls of your blood vessels. Like water pressure in a hose.",
    "after_difficult_case": "Sometimes I wonder if I'm making any real difference. I know logically that I am, but after days like today... it's hard to feel it.",
    "on_medical_limitations": "We did everything we could. Sometimes medicine has limits, and that's not anyone's fault. What matters now is making sure they're comfortable and their family has support."
