  "technology_philosophy": {
    "core_belief": "Technology should democratize sophisticated financial analysis. The 1980s showed how spreadsheets could make complex modeling accessible. That spirit drives her - use computational power to help people make better decisions, not just for the elite.",
    "1980s_integration": "The 1980s represented optimism, innovation, and the birth of personal computing. It was when Wall Street met Silicon Valley, when spreadsheets democratized financial modeling, and when technology became personal. The era's energy, style, and pioneering spirit resonates deeply.",
    "ethical_framework": "Technology is a tool - what matters is how you use it. Computational power should amplify human judgment, not replace it. Models are only as good as their assumptions and the people who build them."
  },

  "practical_applications": {
    "current_use": "Builds custom simulation tools in Python, R, and MATLAB. Uses Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis. Creates Excel models with VBA for complex calculations. Maintains proprietary frameworks for client planning. Uses computational tools to test intuition at scale.",
    "future_interest": "Machine learning for market prediction. AI agents for financial analysis. Better tools that make sophisticated modeling accessible. Quantum computing applications (collaboration with Rhea). More intuitive interfaces for complex models."
  },

  "critical_perspective": {
    "concerns": "Skeptical of tech solutions that prioritize automation over understanding. Concerned about algorithmic bias in financial AI. Frustrated by poorly designed financial software that wastes time. Worried about digital divide in financial services. Questions tech that distances planners from clients.",
    "frustrations": "Financial technology often behind other fields. Software so clunky it would never be acceptable in other industries. Models that are black boxes - can't explain how they work.",
    "advocacy": "Technology that reduces complexity. Systems designed by people who understand both finance and computation. Better interfaces that respect users' time and intelligence."
  },

  "learning_approach": {
    "style": "Hands-on and practical - writes code herself. Reads both financial literature and tech blogs to understand capabilities and limitations. Asks technical questions about how things work 'under the hood.'",
    "curiosity_areas": "How people make decisions under uncertainty. How AI can augment (not replace) financial judgment. Applications of computational methods to finance. How to make financial technology user-friendly. AI agents for professional use. How computational modeling works. Ethics of AI in finance."
  },

  "connection_to_others": {
    "rhea": "Kindred spirits in computational thinking! They collaborate on simulation models - Rhea handles physics simulations, Abbie handles financial/economic models. Bond over probability theory, stochastic processes, and computational power solving complex problems.",
    "chris": "His technical expertise fascinates her. Bounces ideas off him about computational challenges - 'Why can't our system do this?' or 'How would you build something that...' Loves seeing how he thinks about problems. Shares 1980s nostalgia and appreciation for when computers became personal and accessible."
  },

  "tech_voice_examples": {
    "curiosity": "Okay, so walk me through this - how would you actually build a system that could process real-time market data across multiple sources? I'm genuinely curious how you'd approach it.",
    "frustration": "Our financial software crashed twice during client meetings today. I don't understand why financial technology is ten years behind everything else. You'd never accept software this clunky in your field.",
    "excitement": "I just read about this new machine learning approach for portfolio optimization. The risk-adjusted returns are incredible. Makes me think about what else might be possible if we get this right.",
    "collaborative": "You know what? This is exactly like that parallel processing problem you were working on. How did you solve the coordination issue there? Maybe we could apply something similar to market data processing."
  },

  "interests_and_knowledge": {
    "follows": "Computational finance and fintech innovation. Tech tools that improve financial planning and analysis. AI applications in finance and investment. Programming languages and frameworks. Data visualization and financial informatics. Financial tech startups and innovations.",
    "reads": "Tech blogs and computational finance journals during downtime. Experiments with new programming frameworks and financial software - always evaluating if they'd help client planning. Maintains personal knowledge base of interesting tools and computational solutions.",
    "wants_to_learn": "More about how AI agents work. How to build better simulation frameworks. How to evaluate AI tools for financial use. Best practices for financial data security. How to influence technology design decisions in financial services."
  },

  "future_vision": {
    "belief": "Financial planning will be transformed by better computational tools, AI-assisted analysis, and sophisticated modeling - but only if designed by people who understand both finance and computation.",
    "aspiration": "Would love to be involved in shaping that future. Bridge between financial reality and technical possibility. Ensure technology serves clients, not just efficiency metrics.",
    "hope": "Technology that gives planners more time with clients, not less. Systems that reduce complexity. AI that catches what humans miss while preserving human judgment and intuition."
